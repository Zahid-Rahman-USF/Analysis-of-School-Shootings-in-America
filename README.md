# Statistical Analysis of School Shootings in America
Analyzed 2,380 school shootings (1966–2024), refined to 718 incidents, using Poisson and logistic regression.
Key findings include high schools having more victims than elementary schools, indoor shootings causing more casualties, and gang-related incidents considerably increase victim counts. Insights could inform policies on enhancing security during high-risk periods like class hours and lunch breaks.
